Time of day is useful but also analyzing by day of week is useful.

## **Summary**
This data highlights the levels of analysis that could be present for the Des Moines adoption of the Citi bike program in Iowa. 

**Future Analyses of Interest:**
- Adding in logic to the Station ID to indicate which burough the trip begins or ends in. This would allow for cross-burough analyses in the future.
- Leveraging the rider age dimension would also for a deeper analysis of the subscriber versus one-time user dimension. Understanding how the age of both segments shifts over time could have impacts on where new stations could be added.
